# Machine-Learning-By-Andrew-Ng-Coursera-octave-Standford-University

It contains the programming questions of Coursera's ML course by Andrew Ng by Standford University which was recently updated by Coursera with new questions also updated in it.

There is no Week 1, Week10 and Week 11 section as there is no programming assignment in them they all have quizes in it only. 

All the weeks have quiz too with programming assignments except above mentioned.

Looking for quiz answers pull requests so anybody can commit for the same in the repository.

Any problem related to any stuff mail at jaindhruvdj007@gmail.com with your query.
