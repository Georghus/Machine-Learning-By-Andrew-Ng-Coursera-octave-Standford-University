### Machine-Learning-By-Andrew-Ng-Coursera-octave-Standford-University

It contains the programming questions of Coursera's Machine Learning course by Standford University which was recently updated by Coursera with new questions also updated in it.

Instructor: Andrew Ng

### Credits
This repo contains my work for this specialization. The code base, quiz questions and diagrams are taken from the Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera, unless specified otherwise.

### 2022 Version
This specialization was updated in April 2021 to include developments in deep learning and programming frameworks, with the biggest change being shifting from TensorFlow 1 to TensorFlow 2. This repo has been updated accordingly as well.

### Disclaimer
I recognize the time people spend on building intuition, understanding new concepts and debugging assignments. The solutions uploaded here are only for reference. They are meant to unblock you if you get stuck somewhere. Please do not copy any part of the code as-is (the programming assignments are fairly easy if you read the instructions carefully). Similarly, try out the quizzes yourself before you refer to the quiz solutions. This course is the most straight-forward deep learning course I have ever taken, with fabulous course content and structure. It's a treasure by the deeplearning.ai team.

# There is no Week 1, Week10 and Week 11 section as there is no programming assignment in them they all have quizes in it only. 

# All the weeks have quiz too with programming assignments except above mentioned.

# Looking for quiz answers pull requests so anybody can commit for the same in the repository.

## Any problem related to any stuff mail at jaindhruvdj007@gmail.com with your query.
